# pytorch_dsb2018

* This is my Pytorch code used for the Data Science Bowl 2018 Challenge. However, the
  boilerplate code is fairly general and can be used as a template for deep networks on
  images.
* Implemetation includes:
  * Setting up models, optimizers, and schedulers
  * Loading and saving of checkpoints
  * Logging of metrics
  * Run seamlessly on CPU or GPU
  * Multi-objective learning
  * Instance and class weights
  * A refined plateau learn rate scheduler
  * A custom img_aug augmentor for random 5-crops
  * An implementation of group-normalization
  * Plotting and comparing of learning curves
  * Miscellaneous image pre/postprocessing functions
  * IOU (intersection-over-union) calculations
  * Code for failure mode analysis
  * A statistics class to incrementally compute average, std deviations, min and max
